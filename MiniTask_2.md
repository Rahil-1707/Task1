# **Mini Task 2**
## **Remote controlled car using Cardboard**

The first and foremost thing that we get reminded of when thinking about electronics is buiilding a remote controlled car using an arduino. Recently I found this project (https://www.instructables.com/Remote-Controlled-Car-Using-Cardboard/) and found it very intresting.

Here, I describe the project in my own words.

### **Introduction**
This project is a very basic project involving few components and Arduino. With a descent understanding of the code written for arduino as well on doing correct wiring one can easily make this project.

### **Description**

- This project gives a step by step by procedure of how an Remote Controlled Car can be made by using arduino.

- Steps 1 and 2 clearly describe the designing procedure of the circuit. The schematic of the circuit is as shown below

- step 3 consists of PCB assembly and the below gif gives us a good idea idea of how it could be done

- Steps 4 - 10 involves how to make the body of the Car using the cardboard. It consists of beautiful gifs and images which could be used to follow on while making the car.

- Steps 11 involves programming the RC car. This is very simple step because the code is directly given to us we need just upload this code to Arduino Nano using the mini USB cable. The link to the code is https://github.com/Rahil-1707/Task1/blob/main/code_2.ino. The code is very well written and intutive.

- Steps 12 - 14 involve making the body of the remote. The author has also given special dxf files that give a clear idea of the drawings and how the cutting of the cardboard should be done.

- Step 15 involves programming the remote control. This is similar to step 11 and the program just needs to directly uploaded to the Arduino Nano of the remote. The link to the code is https://github.com/Rahil-1707/Task1/blob/main/remote_code_2.ino.

- Now it's play time. One can control and play with the newly built RC car. The final working prototype of the car is as shown below

### ***Some areas to improve on***

- The project was highly illustrative and clear but it could be made better. Instead of just making all 4 motors work we could have made only two bacj wheels work while the 2 front wheels can be used for direction. An axle can be added between the wheels and arduino be programmed such that it moves left and right according to the right joystick of the remote. While the front and the back wheels can move forward and backward. This would ensure smoother turning of the car and will able to take larger turns as and when required.
