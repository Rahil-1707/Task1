# **Mini Task 4**

## **Joule Theif from a Beer Can**

### **Introduction**

First of all let me explain what a joule theif circuit is, The Joule Thief Circuit is a voltage booster circuit which converts a constant low voltage input into a periodic output of a higher voltage. This circuit can be most often seen lighting an LED with an almost dead AA battery. The peaks in voltage occur rapidly, causing the LED to flash at a very fast rate. However, the LED appears to be constantly lit to the human eye due to the persistence effect.

This is a quite useful application as many times I feel that the battries that come out of my remotes, clocks, etc are not fully used and some of money is wasted because of incomplete utilization of the battery.

Recently I viewed a project on instructabels and found it intresting, here is the link to the project (https://www.instructables.com/Supercapacitor-Joule-Thief/). This is my breif explaination of the project.

### **Description**

The principle behind this circuit is quite difficult to understand but the video describes it nicely. Even if one can't understand the principle, but you know the application and the process of building it. Therefore it shouldn't stop us to explore it. Even we don't know what electricity is, but still we are able to make billions of applications around it that helps the world in various ways. So, let's build up the circuit.

First of all the webpage describes the list of components that are used and also it gives to purchase these online. The components used here are - BC637 NPN BJT, 1kΩ or 2kΩ Resistor, Ferrite Toroid Core, Enameled copper wire, LED, Supercapacitor.

Building the circuit we need to follow the schematic given to us as below

After we wound our transformer, the way it was demonstrated in the video, we only need to create 5 solder joints according to the schematic to connect the components to one another. Feel free to change the value of the base resistor as demonstrated it in the video.

And it's done.

It looks something like this

And you are done with the project.

### **Some areas for improvement**

- A similar project can be made by using a battery instead of a capacitor. And here is a link for this type of project (https://www.instructables.com/The-Joule-Thief/). 

- Also, one could make this device a bit portable and the wires needs to be placed properly, to maximize the utilization of the device. Overall this is a wonderful project but without making it portable this device will have no use.
